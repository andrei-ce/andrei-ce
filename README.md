# I'm Andrei 👋 

### About me 👨🏻‍💻

I have always worked in tech: business analyst for a big telecom and IoT company, Product Manager for a e-learning app, full-stack developer for a pet food service app and a virtual meeting platform. I started by developer journey in 2019, by eventually asking myself the question "how does the web work?". I am a curious person so I searched for some tutorials and even attended an intensive on site MERN bootcamp. A few weeks after graduation I broke into the software development market as a FullStack Web Developer for a start-up in Barcelona.

### Tech Stack 🛠
- Node & Express
- React & Redux
- MongoDB 
- MySQL

### My learning pipeline 🌱
*(last updated on Apr/23)*
- React (80%): 1 year experience, but always improving!
- Node (80%): 1 year experience, learning caching, socket.io, 
- Next.js (50%): I learned next routing, seo, api, server side rendering. Now studying serverless functions
- Typescript(50%): I have worked professionaly on small improvements on Node.js and React.js
- PostgreSQL, Sequelize (50%): I am more confortable with mongoDB, but SQL is the way to go in many architectures
- GraphQL (10%): Just dipped my toes by applying it on an e-commerce personal project
- Java (10%): Just dipped my toes by building an API that consumes images and adds a little bit of flavor to them

### Some deployed apps 🚀

- [DnD Quiz](https://dnd-quiz.andrei-ce.vercel.app/): A quick quizz app that uses React and Styled Components, but that I used mainly to get to know Next.js & Vercel features such as SEO, Server Side Rendering, Internal routes and public API routes(with React). The 4 links on the bottom load external (other quizzes) API data & theme colors.
- [Transparent Government in Fact](https://andrei-ce.github.io/TGiF/): Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS to build a website that fetches data from US Congress and presents attendance & voting statistics
