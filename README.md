# I'm Andrei 👋 

### About me 👨🏻‍💻

I have always worked in tech: business analyst for a big telecom and IoT company, Product Manager for a e-learning app, full-stack developer for a pet food service app and a virtual meeting platform. I've always been a fan of simplifying life though computers and connectivity, and in 2020 I an opportunity to learn how and web application works. So as a curious person I started to learn it by myself and eventually attended intensive on-site MERN bootcamp. A few weeks after the bootcamp graduation I broke into the software development market as a FullStack Web Developer for a start-up in Barcelona.

### Tech Stack 🛠

- Typescript
- Node (Express, Fastify and exploring Nest)
- React (including Next and state managers e.g. Redux)
- MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB and typeORMs like Knux and Prisma
- Docker

### My learning pipeline 🌱
*(last updated on Aug/23)*
- Node, React & Next.js: experienced, but always improving!
- Docker & Typescript: intermediate
- Systems Design @[Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/path/deep-dive-into-system-design-interview)

### Some deployed apps 🚀
