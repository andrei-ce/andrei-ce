# Hey there, I'm Andrei 👋 

### About me 👨🏻‍💻

I got curious about how the web works, so I bought some online courses in 2019. After getting hooked on it, I immediately looked for an intensive on site bootcamp, learnt the MERN stack, and a few weeks after graduation I began working as a Jr. FullStack Web Developer for a start-up in Barcelona.

### Tech Stack 🛠
- Node.js
- React & Redux when needed
- MongoDB 
- Express.js
- new libraries & technologies welcomed!

### My learning pipeline 🌱
*(last updated on Jan/2021)*
- React (80%): 1 year experience, but always improving!
- PostgreSQL (25%): I am more confortable with mongoDB, but SQL is important too
- Next.js (25%): I learned next routing, seo, api, server side rendering
- React Native (25%): I learned about component styling, new (mobile) components, and navigation v5
- GraphQL (10%): Just dipped my toes
- Typescript: TBD
- Python: TBD

### Some deployed apps 🚀
- [MyTinerary](https://mytinerary-ac.herokuapp.com/): Used MaterialUI, React/Redux, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB to create user owned curated itineraries for best spots in different towns
- [DnD Quiz](https://dnd-quiz.andrei-ce.vercel.app/): A quick quizz app that uses React and Styled Components, but that I used mainly to get to know Next.js & Vercel features such as SEO, Server Side Rendering, Internal routes and public API routes(with React). The 4 links on the bottom load external (other quizzes) API data & theme colors.
- [DevConnector](https://devconnector-ac.herokuapp.com/profile/5e74b94cdb8e42859be4567a): Experimenting with React Hooks & GitHub API to create a social netork mvp
- [Transparent Government in Fact](https://andrei-ce.github.io/TGiF/): Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS to build a website that fetches data from US Congress and presents attendance & voting statistics

### Hobbies 🤓
- Bicycles 🚲 
- Camping 🏕
- Games 🎮
