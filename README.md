# I'm Andrei 👋 

### About me 👨🏻‍💻

I have always loved and worked in tech: business analyst for a big telecom and IoT company, Product Manager for a e-learning app, full-stack developer for a pet food service app and a virtual meeting platform. Throughout my life I've experienced first hand how the internet and software changed people's life. In 2020, because of life circumstances, I ws faced witn an opportunity to take a detour in my carreer and learn how to build web applications. So as a curious person, I started to learn it by myself and then attended an intensive on-site MERN bootcamp in Barcelona. This detour became the main road ever since.
