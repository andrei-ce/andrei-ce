### About me 👨🏻‍💻

I'm Andrei 👋   
I have always loved and worked in tech: strategy development for a big telecom and IoT company, product management for a e-learning app, and full-stack development for a pet food service app and a virtual meeting platform. Throughout my life I've experienced first hand how the internet and software changed people's life. In 2020, I moved between countries (once more) and was faced with an opportunity to take a detour in my carreer and learn how to build web applications. As a curious person, I jumped head first and started to learn it by myself. I then attended an intensive on-site MERN bootcamp in Barcelona. This detour became my main road ever since!

### Tech Stack 🛠
*(opened to learn more tools)*
- Typescript
- Node (Express, Fastify and exploring Nest)
- React (including Next and state managers e.g. Redux)
- MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB and ORMs like Knux and Prisma
- Docker

### My learning pipeline 🌱
*(last updated on Aug/23)*
- Systems Design @[Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/path/deep-dive-into-system-design-interview)
- Node, React & Next.js: experienced, but always improving!
- Docker & Typescript: intermediate
- Reactive Native: beginner, applied on a handful of projects
- GraphQL: beginner, applied on a personal e-commerce project
- C# & Java: feet in the water. Technologies I've used for small projects or small improvements in large projects

### Some deployed apps 🚀

- [Calme](https://calme-mu.vercel.app): Scheduling full-stack application using server side functions from Next. For the UI I used my own (wip) [design system](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@celoco-ui/react), which leverages Radix UI. This app syncs to your google calendar email.
- [DnD Quiz](https://dnd-quiz.andrei-ce.vercel.app/): A quick quizz app that uses React and Styled Components, but that I used mainly to get to know Next.js & Vercel features such as SEO, Server Side Rendering, Internal routes and public API routes(with React). The 4 links on the bottom load external (other quizzes) API data & theme colors.
- [Transparent Government in Fact](https://andrei-ce.github.io/TGiF/): Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS to build a website that fetches data from US Congress and presents attendance & voting statistics
- [Bookshelf](https://bookshelf-ac.herokuapp.com/): Experimenting with Chakra UI (themes, light/dark modes...), using React (hooks), Redux, MongoDB, Express & NodeJs -- 🚧 OFFLINE, MIGRATING FROM HEROKU 🚧
- [MyTinerary](https://mytinerary-ac.herokuapp.com/): Used MaterialUI, React/Redux, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB to create user owned curated itineraries for best spots in different towns -- 🚧 OFFLINE, MIGRATING FROM HEROKU 🚧
