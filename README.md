# Hey there, I'm Andrei 👋 

### About me 👨🏻‍💻

I got curious about how the web is built, so I bought some online courses to dip my toes in the waters. After that I immediately looked for an intensive bootcamp, learnt the MERN stack, and a few weeks after graduation I began working as a FullStack Web Developer. It's been over a year now and I look back with no regrets :)

### Tech Stack 🛠
My current preferred stack is NodeJS, React, Redux (when needed), and MongoDB, but I am always trying to experiment with new libraries & technologies.
